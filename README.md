# Kickstarter-Analysis
performing Analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trend
### Crowd Funding Analysis
---
## Project Overview
This Project is about to analyse the data for the successful funding campaign by Louis for her Play "fever". Her Goal is about $10,000 Dollars. So she want to do the trending calculation with excel and analysing the markups.
## Purpose 
Louis is Planing for the successful campaign for the targeted goal.
## Analysis & Challenges

Analysis Process is done with the excel, which the link is found above . 
###Step 1 : Analysing the data by sort and filter along with adding columns. The first column is for "Average Donations," to determine how much people usually donate based on incentives and the average is calculated by`=IFERROR(ROUND(E2/L2,2),0)  
###Step 2 : This step is to analyse the data through the date so that campgain can  be analysed by the trend by using unix timestamp to find the date and time by decoding. And It gives success ,failed,canceled ration based on date and months, so the charter shows the trends for the months and datesand year to analysis.  the outcome based on launch date below the charter.

###step 3 : Analysing the data for trends based on categories of crowd-funding campaigns, and it is differentiated  into parent and subcategories. pivot tables and pivot charts were derived to visualizing the data ,If outcomes where successful, failed, or canceled. To initiate several analysis where performed in category , Sub category,Parent Category.
 This data is to show the different category and to analyse he success and failer rate for the campaign.

This data visual showes the percentage of success , failer , canceled ratio to determine how much is acheived

This visual shows that what is outcome based on Theater to determine which month would be good to do the campaign.

###Challenges
My challenge is while caculate the percentage of success , failure and canceled.ratio.in outcome based on goals. with code. i overcome the challenge by revisiting the syllabus and modules. and then figured out .
##Result
Visualizing "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date," Louise should be starting launch date for her Kickstarter campaign in May. May has the highest success rate, in all categorz and campaign can be avoide in December since the rate is low . Both success and failure lines are nearly the same. 
----
 "Outcomes Based on Goals" ,goal less than five thousand dollars tends to have the highest success rate. so have to stick around with fourthousand dollars
 ---
 ###Data limitation
 Sample size of the data should be avoided, it doesnt give the accurate result or information.
 Duration of the play can give more information and the audiance data should will be add on informative .
 -----
 ### Possible table
 reach of audiance, or reach of play. chart can be created for the quarterly bases. years graphs.
